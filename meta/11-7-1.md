  Park refers to publicly owned and operated parks. Every kind of park within
  the municipal boundary of the city, including federal, state, county,
  regional, and municipal parks is counted. Private golf or other clubs, or
  parks in gated communities are counted in the data.  The data from all the
  different park agencies in the city are combined. For 2013-2016 parks are
  separated by their management agency. City refers to the municipality, not the
  metropolitan region. Thus, “Los Angeles” means the City of Los Angeles, not
  greater Los Angeles, nor Los Angeles County.
